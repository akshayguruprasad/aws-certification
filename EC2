#ICMP=Internet Controll Messaging Protocol
It is used to send error messages to the source from the routers,the intermediate layers so as to rectify the error of sending the packet over the network
It contains of the IP Source and the message.
It is sent as a datagram 
It is mostly used in diagnosis such as ping and traceroute
It is used to handle the DOS(Denial of Service) or POD (Ping of Death)
ICMP is mostly sent from the router to the host to it is connected to and in aws it is used in jumbo frames
Jumbo Frames is the concept where the data is sent in packets to the host from the other host.
Jumbo Frames are large data carriers .This can be achieved by increasing the payload of the packet rather than sending multiple packetsw withe the same overheads
These overheads (.....redundent data which is not a business related one)
Sending the data in packets is a measured in MTU
(Maximum Transfer Units)
These units are 1500 in maximum in the Internet but in aws we can use jumbo frames to send more amount of data which can go upto 9001
we can use Jumbo Frames in internat network , VPC paring only.


what happens if data is more in MTU ??
In that case the gateway tries to fragment it by checking the fragement flag is set or not 
Creates error message respectively and sends to the host as ICMP message
